# Email Downloader and Parser

The project available in the 100 Days of Code is more focused on creating an Automated Birthday Wisher: based on birthday dates, an automatic email will be sent to a specific person.

I was more intersted in learning how to fetch, parse and extract information (links for instance) from my own emails, therefore the day_32 folder contains a script to:

- Connect to my Gmail account
- Read and fetch the email content
- Parse the email content and extract links in it
- Save the content in a JSON file
