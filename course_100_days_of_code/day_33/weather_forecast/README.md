# Weather Forecast Data

The project available in the 100 Days of Code is more focused on creating an ISS Overhead Notifier Project: based on the latitude and longitude of the ISS (International Space Station), if the position is exactly above where you live, you should receive an email that says "Look at the Ski!".

I was more interested in learning how to fetch weather forecast data, therefore this application will be focus more on it.
