# 1. Let's find out how many different colour LEGO bricks are actually in production.
# Read the colors.csv file from the data folder and find the total number of unique colours.
# There's a number of different ways you can accomplish this. Maybe try using the .nunique() from Pandas.
import pandas as pd

# 2. Figure out how many of the LEGO colours are transparent compared to how many colours are opaque.
# See if you can Google your way to finding at least two different ways of arriving at the answer.
